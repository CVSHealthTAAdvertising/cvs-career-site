# CVS Career Site
Custom CSS and Javascript files for landing pages on CVS/SmashFly Career Site

### custom-page_styles.css

This is the main css file to edit that overrides or adds existing styles to the SmashFly landing pages.

### Lity, OwlCarousel, & RoyalSlider

These are all third-party css and javascript plugins to add dynamic elements to certain pages like carousels and lightboxes. It is recommended to not make edits to these files but instead override styles in the custom-page_styles.css file.

### Instructions for referencing files in SmashFly html editor

After forking this repository, you can make edits to the custom-page_styles.css file and also upload additional files to host and reference if you wish. 

If the html file you're editing is referencing muliptile css files and javascript files (like the example below), make sure to place the custom-page_styles.css file or any newly created css files after the Lity, OwlCarousel and RoyalSlider files. Also, if the page you're editing has is referencing a <script>, make sure you hit the <strong>Design</strong> button and then <strong>Update</strong> after editing the html, or else SmashFly with for some reason strip the rest of your code. It's always a good idea to keep a local copy of the file/code in the case that this happens. 

```
<link href="https://hireclix.github.io/cvs-career-site/lity/lity.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://hireclix.github.io/cvs-career-site/lity/lity.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://hireclix.github.io/cvs-career-site/custom-page_styles.css">
<div class="searchBar gray-search">&nbsp;</div>
<section id="howtoapply">
```

Once you've updated a file and want to reference either replace the url for the custom-page_styles.css file or add your new css file before the <div class"seacherBar> (if the page has one) or first section tag of the landing page. You're new link structure with be https://<strong>username</strong>.github.io/cvs-career-site/<strong>file-name</strong>.css
